# Antipodal Explorer

An interactive web application that shows where you would emerge if you dug straight through the center of the Earth from your current location.

## Features

- Geolocation to determine your current position
- Calculation of the antipodal point (opposite side of the Earth)
- Reverse geocoding to find location names
- Interactive 3D Earth visualization
- Animated journey through the Earth's core

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 Geolocation API
- CSS3 animations and 3D transforms
- JavaScript ES6+
- OpenStreetMap Nominatim API for reverse geocoding

## How It Works

1. The app requests permission to access your current location
2. It calculates the antipodal point (the exact opposite point on the globe)
3. It displays both locations on an interactive 3D Earth visualization
4. You can start a virtual journey animating the path through the Earth's core
5. Information about both locations is displayed, including coordinates and place names
